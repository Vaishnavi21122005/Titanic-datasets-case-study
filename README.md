Titanic Survival Prediction
This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not using machine learning.

 Dataset
Source: Titanic CSV (GitHub)

Target Column: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

 Tools Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

 What the Project Does
Loads the dataset from GitHub

Cleans missing values (e.g., Age, Embarked)

Does basic data analysis and visualizations

Builds a machine learning model (Random Forest)

Evaluates the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

How to Run It
Make sure Python is installed

Install required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run the Python script or Jupyter notebook

 Output Example
Accuracy: ~83%
